            <p>Sustainability is a fuzzy word.We’re attempting to do as good as we can. By looking across the whole supply chain in the cycle of the clothing industry, we know it’s impact and what collision it causes worldwide.</p> <br>
             <p> We want to stay as transparent as possible regarding our steps and way of working with sustainability. It is within our companies vision to speak out about how we’re working, about our core values and not to communicate anything that’s misleading and causes a false image. As a company with much manufacturing activities, we know that we have a responsibility towards our customers and suppliers.</p> <br>
             <p> Sustainability is one of our core pillars. We are very proud of what we’ve accomplished so far. We continue to have a high percentage of sustainable products in our collection and aiming to increase our percentage in the future as we growing. We will continue to launch new initiatives to lower our carbon footprint even further and displaying our way of working to maintain honestly trough the process.</p>

<h2>
    At Silfen we’re learning and we’re improving.Perfection doesn’t exist here.
</h2>
<h2>
    There’s no such thing as a sustainable fashion brand.But we can make clothes in a better way and be honest about how we produce them.
</h2>
<h2>
    Let’s share the progress we’ve made and the challenges we face.
</h2>

<article> The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and contamination of drinking water. We try to minimize the water consumption in our production in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the environment and to ensure local access to clean water.

    All cotton used for production of SILFEN bags is either made from eco-friendly or organic cotton. This means that there is much less consumption of water throughout production and treatment of our cotton, than conventional cotton products.
    
    In 2020 we will introduce a new collection of bags made from a new material; rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled material is primarily made from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the world.</article>
<article>
    At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put their children in school.

Team Silfen provides insurance to all our hard-working employees as well as their family. Our factories also grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial stability after retirement.

We support the different religions of employees and protect their right to engage with rituals, prayers etc. at any time. We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the employees are protected from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.

We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is always crafted in a responsible manner.

All our manufacturers are SA8000 certified.

<article>We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as much as possible – by joining forces.

    We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are the most environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing polluting emissions.</article>
